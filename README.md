# TankBot
Reddit bot that scrapes the current bottom 10 teams in the standings every 10 minutes, and outputs as a reddit-formatted table in the sidebar.

For TankBot to run, the process needs to stay open while it sleeps. It can also be run once a day, or whichever way is most convenient for the user.
